Welcome to my GitHub repository for the Summer Internship 2024! This project showcases the work done during the internship, including practical insights and hands-on experience with Wordpress technology.

Understood the clientâ€™s requirements and the project structure.

I dedicated significant time to research and development activities for the website, exploring various design concepts and functionality requirements. This involved studying user preferences, industry trends, and competitor strategies to ensure a competitive edge. 

Additionally, I analyzed different technologies and frameworks suitable for implementation, aiming to optimize performance and user experience.

In exploring WordPress, I learned that it is a widely used open-source content management system (CMS) that simplifies website creation and management. Known for its user-friendly interface, WordPress offers extensive customization options through themes and plugins. It supports SEO best practices and responsive design, making it suitable for both beginners and experienced users. Additionally, the active community provides valuable support and regular updates.

Choose the proper theme from the envato and do the setup for that using wp manager on the computer.
